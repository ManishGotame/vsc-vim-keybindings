# Custom keybindings for vim and vscode

I use vim in vscode and here are some of my custom keybindings to improve my workflow.

## To Apply the keybindings

1. Open Command Palette → Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)
2. Paste the config above inside your JSON.
3. Save the file and reload VSCode (or just the Vim extension).
